    // Using code snippets from previous excercise:
    // 1. write a code that will add 100 todos with names: TODO#1 TODO#2... TODO#100
    // 2. change the delay value in setSlowMo to 1ms or remove it completely
    // 3. mark all TODOs with odd numbers as done
    // 4. switch the view on webpage from "All" to "Active" only (it should hide the done TODOs)
    // 5. Log to console number of TODOs displayed by "Active" view
